---

Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit my manuscript "A Measure-Theoretic Discrete
Curvature Framework for Metabolic Gene Sensitivity: From Active-Set
Geometry to Transcriptional Response" for consideration as an Original
Research Article in the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology.

Parametric flux balance analysis defines a piecewise-affine map from
environmental and genetic parameters to optimal metabolic fluxes. The
manuscript establishes that the distributional second derivative of this
map is a matrix-valued Radon measure concentrated on the codimension-one
strata of the active-set complex — a discrete curvature carrier — and
that this measure, rather than any smooth curvature, organizes the
network's rerouting geometry. Three results make the work suitable for
the journal's readership:

1. **A theory with a proved refinement bridge.** The atomic measure
   converges weakly to the smooth curvature density under mesh
   refinement, with a strong $L^1$ reconstruction law and an exact
   counterexample calculus replacing earlier total-variation claims
   (Theorem B'). The value layer (biomass objective) is provably
   tie-break-free; loop holonomy scales linearly in loop size —
   slope 1.000000 — where any smooth map would scale quadratically.

2. **A validated, robustly tested gene-sensitivity metric.** From the
   measure the manuscript derives a per-gene sensitivity score and
   shows, in *E. coli* (M3D microarrays, n = 424), that it predicts
   carbon-depletion transcriptional response
   (r = +0.395, p = 2.6 × 10⁻¹⁷; partial r = +0.269). The association
   survives every robustness check in the manuscript: metric invariance
   (ρ = 0.99998), five lexicographic tie-break conventions with the
   value layer exactly invariant, path variation, cross-platform
   replication (dissociating on PRECISE, as the layer theory predicts),
   and Glivenko–Cantelli stabilization of the underlying event measures
   across random panels. The association does not propagate to the
   protein layer (proteome r = −0.083 vs. transcript +0.419): cells
   transcribe the potential for rerouting while buffering translation.

3. **Biology beyond correlation.** The same geometry organizes
   double-knockout epistasis (Spearman ρ_S = 0.865 against active-set
   structure) and predicts the phenotypic memory of genetic loops
   (66% non-reverting).

The mathematics is deliberately classical — parametric linear
programming (chamber complexes, active sets, Danskin duality),
Alexandrov's theorem, and distributional second derivatives of
piecewise-affine maps — applied systematically to flux-balance models
for the first time, I believe, at this level of exactness. This
methods-plus-application character is, in my view, a direct fit for
the Bulletin's mathematical-biology readership.

**Disclosure of a related manuscript.** In the interest of full
transparency I disclose that a companion manuscript is in preparation
for separate submission to *Theory and Applications of Categories*
(a no-fee, diamond open-access journal): "Stratified Connections,
Optic Composition, and the Homotopy Fixed-Point Extension: A
Categorical Framework for Viability-Weighted Curvature" (theory
paper). The two papers are related but distinct in purpose, and the
division of labor is deliberate:

- The **submitted manuscript** is the application: the
  measure-theoretic curvature of parametric FBA, the gene-level metric
  κ^μ, and the genome-scale empirical association with its layer
  decision. It is self-contained: all theorems it uses are proved in
  its own appendices, and no empirical claim depends on the companion.
  It carries only a brief, adapted summary of the categorical reading
  that motivated the active-set curvature interpretation (its §3.5),
  with explicit pointers to the companion for the constructions and
  proofs.
- The **companion manuscript** (provided below) develops the full
  categorical framework — stratified connections, optic composition,
  filtered colimits, the homotopy-type-theoretic extension — with its
  own proofs and machine verifications. It cites the submitted
  manuscript for the application.

The two manuscripts share no verbatim passages of length; each was
written to stand alone; neither presents the other's results as its
own. The companion is available for the editors' and reviewers'
inspection in the same public repository as the submitted
manuscript's code and data
(https://github.com/MIKEAA2020/metabolic-curvature-measure, file
`scripts/companion_categorical_v3.tex`, compiled PDF included) and will
be provided as a PDF on request; it is not under consideration
elsewhere.

The computational work is fully reproducible: every figure and number
in the manuscript is regenerated by committed scripts from deposited
artifacts, verified by a 98-check numeric audit (98/98 PASS) that
re-derives each manuscript value from its committed artifact. All
code, data manifests (SHA-256), and artifacts are publicly available;
all biological data are public (BiGG models, M3D, PRECISE, PaxDb, and
the condition-dependent *E. coli* proteome). Publication under the
journal's standard (subscription) route is intended; no open-access
charges are requested.

I am the sole author of this manuscript. I conceived the study
design, developed the methodology and analysis code, analyzed the
data, and drafted the manuscript. In accordance with the journal's
policy on generative AI in scientific writing, I disclose that
GLM (Z.ai) and DeepSeek large language models were used as writing
and coding assistants under my direction and supervision; all
assisted content was reviewed, verified, and edited by me, and I
take full responsibility for the content of the manuscript and the
integrity of its results.

I confirm that this manuscript is original, has not been published
previously, and is not under consideration by any other journal. This
work involved no human or animal subjects and required no ethics
approval.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
